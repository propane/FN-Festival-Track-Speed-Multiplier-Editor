Allows setting custom track speed multiplier for Fortnite Festival gamemode

- ATTENTION: 
    Setting the track speed does not change the bpm of the song and all notes will be played at the same time regardless, this is simply a visual adjustment as to how fast notes will appear on your screen.
    Choosing a speed below 1.0 in my opinion does not make the game easier and you will end up with a ton of notes appearing at once scrolling very slowly down your screen that you have to hit extremely quickly on fast songs lol
